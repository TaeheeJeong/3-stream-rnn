    "# Intro to Deep Learning\n",
    "My hope is that this will be a good introduction to what deep learning is, what the objective of it is, how to use it, when to use it, and many of its derivative algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perceptron\n",
    "The basic unit of a neural network is the perceptron displayed below. It takes in a variable amount of inputs, aggregates them according to sum function (could be a linear sum or something else entirely) and then produces an output depending on the output.\n",
    "![Perceptron](img191.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have an input vector $X$, a set of weights $W$ that place a weight on each $x_i \\in X$, an aggregation function $f$, and a activation function $f_i$ which determines if the perceptron will output a 1 or 0(in the binary case). \n",
    "\n",
    "The learning algorithm for a perceptron is rather simple and you can read a complete description [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron#Learning_algorithm). The idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly initialize the weights.\n",
    "2. For 1 training example calculate $y_i = f_i (f(X*W))$.\n",
    "3. $w_inew = w_i + \\alpha * t_j-y_i$ (update the weight with the difference between the target and the actual output scaled by some learning rate alpha.\n",

    "## Multi-layer Perceptrons (Neural Networks)\n",
    "The basic kind of neural network is the multi-layer perceptron(MLP). "
